## 2.A: Codeforces
Codeforces is the most popular platform for competitive programming. If you've been working on Module-1 problems and participated in the recent Division 3 contest, you've likely already used the platform. This module will delve into important details about Codeforces.

## 2.B: Rating
Every Codeforces user has a "rating," a numerical indicator of their performance in past contests, similar to the Elo rating system in Chess. Users are categorized into different rating ranges based on this rating.

Here's a breakdown of rating bounds, colors, titles, and divisions:

| Rating Bounds | Color | Title | Division |
|---|---|---|---|
| $\ge$3000 | Red | Legendary Grandmaster | 1 |
| 2600-2999 | Red | International Grandmaster | 1 |
| 2400-2599 | Red | Grandmaster | 1 |
| 2300-2399 | Orange | International Master | 1 |
| 2100-2299 | Orange | Master | 1 |
| 1900-2099 | Violet | Candidate Master | 1/2 |
| 1600-1899 | Blue | Expert | 2 | 
| 1400-1599 | Cyan | Specialist | 2/3 |
| 1200-1399 | Green | Pupil | 2/3 | 
| $\le$1199 | Gray | Newbie | 2/3 | 

## 2.C: Contests
Codeforces contests typically occur every 2-4 days at 8 PM IST. These contests see participation from 20,000 to 30,000 individuals globally.

There are three main contest types: Div 1, Div 2, and Div 3. Div 1 contests are the most challenging and require a rating of at least 1900 to participate. Div 3 contests, on the other hand, are relatively easier, though still difficult for beginners.

The aim of this workshop is to help you reach a level where you can solve 3 problems in Div 2 and 4 problems in Div 3 contests, provided you solve them quickly enough.

## 2.D: Submission Verdicts
When you submit a solution to a Codeforces problem, you'll receive one of several verdicts:

| Verdict | Description |
|---|---|
| Accepted | Your code produces the correct output for all test cases. |
| Wrong Answer | Your code gives the wrong answer on a test case. |
| Time Limit Exceeded | Your code takes too long to run, indicating inefficiency. |

## 2.E: Stuck on a Problem?
After every Codeforces contest, the writers publish a blog post explaining the solutions to the contest problems. If you're stuck, you can find the corresponding solution by clicking on the "Tutorial" link in the sidebar on the right.

For example, when practicing problems, it's recommended to spend a significant amount of time (like a day) on a problem before consulting the tutorial.

## 2.G: Why should I do Competitive Coding?
1.  **Ideal case**: You have a knack for solving puzzles.
2.  **Money**: If you're a Computer Science student or aiming for a career in IT, competitive coding is crucial for passing Online Assessment rounds for both placements and summer internships. Many at CRUx engage in competitive coding for this very reason.
3.  **To become a better programmer in general**.
